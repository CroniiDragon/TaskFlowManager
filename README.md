# 🎯 TaskFlow Manager

**TaskFlow Manager** is a full-stack web application for collaborative task and project management within teams. Inspired by tools like Trello and Jira, it combines ASP.NET MVC with modern frontend and backend technologies to simulate an enterprise-level application. This project was built as a personal challenge to demonstrate my practical skills across the full .NET development stack.
